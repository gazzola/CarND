# Sliders for Canny and Hough

This is a _very rough_ sketch of a functionality I'd like to see implemented somewhere in CarND: sliders so we can toy around with openCV function parameters (mostly Canny edge detection and Hough line detection, which I think might be the hardest) to get a better grasp of how they affect the output.
